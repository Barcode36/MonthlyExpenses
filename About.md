# MonthlyExpenses 

Simple Project with GUI giving the oportunity (for the user) to add, modify, delete, filter and track expenses.
Project develop in Java powered by SQLite database and GUI based on javafx.scene.control lib. as part of developing and expanding knowledge of JAVA and SQL. 
I planned a few changes in the near future considering changing database to MySQL or PostgreSQL and also add a little more options to app.
